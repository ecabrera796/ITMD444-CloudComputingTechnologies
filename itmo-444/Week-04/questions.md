## Chapter 03 - Selecting a Service Platform

1. Compare IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS on the basis of cost, configurability, and control.
    1. Cost - With IaaS providers charge for compute time, storage, and network traffic. With PaaS, providers charge based on    how much CPU, bandwidth, and storage is used. With SaaS you must make sure you show that you are not locking in any customers and that they see that it is easy to leave when they want.
    2. Configurability - IaaS requires a lot of work to be done in order to coordinate all the pieces and understand and tune all of the parts in order for it to work well together. With PaaS you are not open to add and use any binaries or libraries until the vendor makes them part of its service. With SaaS the provider takes charge of everything and you need to make sure to obscure upgrades and other operational details.
    3. Control - With IaaS you have full control of the OS. With PaaS you do not have direct access to the operating system and need to use the platform the vendor provides. With SaaS the service is fully managed, updated, and maintained by the provider.

2. What are the caveats to consider in adopting Software as a Service?
    1. A huge "red flag" you must consider is if the SaaS provider you are looking into does not seem like they will lock you in and not let you leave their service when you want. You should also look into how much security is offered as you do not want any leaks in the service.

3. List the key advantages of virtual machines.
    1. You can use up a physical machine's stranded capacity to make it more efficient with multiple virtual machines. You can also run multiple servers on a single machine. They are also fast to create and destroy and can be used when you need to do a task that you would not want to run on your machine. It is also good when handling suspicious software/hardware and need a safe environment to test. It is also safe when just wanting to test something out without affecting your actual machine.

4. Why might you choose physical over virtual machines?
    1. You would choose a physical machine over a virtual machine when you need to run something that requires much more power and/or storage. This can include when running a certain application that will use up a lot of CPU power.


5. Which factors might make you choose private over public cloud services?
    1. You might choose a private over public cloud service if you want more control. Private lets you specify what kind of hardware you'll use and which network topology will be set up.

6. Which selection strategy does your current organization use? What are the benefits and caveats of using this strategy?
    1. NA
