## Chapter 02 - Designing for Operations

1. Why is design for operations so important?
    1. Design for operations is important because it allows operational tasks to be done seamlessly. It also allows these features to create the introspection that is needed to debug and repair large systems.

2. How is automated configuration typically supported?
    1.  Automated configuration is typically supported through an API or by reading and updating a configuration file.

3. List the important factors for redundancy through replication.
    1. You must segregate these kinds of queries even if the database you are replicating does not have any other replicas.

4. Give an example of a partially implemented process in your current environment. What would you do to fully implement it?
    1. A partially implemented process I could think of is the software in the beta for the popular video game PUBG. In order to fully implement it for the full release they should seriously consider fixing the anti-aliasing and the frame rate.

5. Why might you not want to solve an issue by coding the solution yourself?
    1. This might not be the best solutions because your code might not be accepted by the developers and also this can make developers lazy because they will see that if they ignore issues long enough then someone will eventually write them themselves.

6. Which type of problems should appear first on your priority list?
    1. You should first list the issues that will have the biggest impact for the smallest amount of effort.

7. Which factors can you bring to an outside vendor to get the vendor to take your issue seriously?
    1. You should raise awareness of your issues in a constructive way because vendors tend to that criticism towards their products seriously. Also, write a postmortem that includes the feature request so that the vendor can see them clearly.
